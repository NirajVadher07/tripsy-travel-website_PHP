# Tripsy Travel Website (PHP)

The **Tripsy Travel Website (PHP)** is an extension of the original [tripsy](https://github.com/NirajVadher07/tripboss_travel) website. Initially, "tripsy" was a static website crafted with HTML, CSS, and JS. However, this new version has evolved into a full-stack travel website, utilizing WAMP Technologies for development.

## Technology Stack:

- **PHP**: The website employs PHP as its scripting language, enabling dynamic functionality and interaction with the server.
- **TAILWIND CSS**: To enhance the website's appearance and styling, the developers utilized TAILWIND CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework.
- **MySQL**: As the chosen database management system, MySQL stores and manages the website's data efficiently.

This amalgamation of technologies results in an engaging and interactive travel website, providing users with a seamless experience while planning their trips. The utilization of a full-stack approach allows for more dynamic features and better handling of user data, enhancing the overall user experience.
